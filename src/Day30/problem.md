# Day 30: Number of 1 Bits (Hamming Weight)

## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string has a total of three '1' bits.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
```

## Constraints

- The input must be a binary string of length `32`.

## Follow-up
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Topics
- Bit Manipulation
- Divide and Conquer

## Note
Congratulations on completing the 30-day DSA challenge! This final problem demonstrates bit manipulation, a crucial skill for optimization and low-level programming. Throughout this journey, you've covered:

- Arrays, Strings, Hashing
- Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Trees (DFS, BFS)
- Binary Search
- Heaps, Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- And now: Bit Manipulation!

Keep practicing and building on these foundations!
